# Employee Salary Prediction

This project is focused on predicting employee salaries using various features from a provided dataset. The workflow includes data analysis, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## 📁 Files

- `Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and modeling.
- `Employers_data.csv`: Dataset with employee-related data (must be placed in the same directory for the notebook to work).

## 📌 Features

- Data Import and Initial Exploration
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis
- Machine Learning Model for Salary Prediction
- Model Evaluation

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure Python is installed along with the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells to go through data analysis and model training.

## 📊 Output

The notebook includes:
- Summary statistics and feature overview
- Data visualizations (heatmaps, distribution plots)
- Machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression)
- Evaluation using metrics such as R² Score and RMSE

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- Add more sophisticated models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Improve documentation with markdown cells
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for user interaction
